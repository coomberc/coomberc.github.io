# Short Love Stories

<img src="/public/images/short-love-stories.webp" alt='Hilary' style="width: 300px; float: right; padding-left: 20px;" />ARE YOU IN LOVE?

Out of love?

We’ve all been there …

And every aspect of love is in this

book, from cradle to grave.

So sit back, relax, and let love wash over you.

The profits from this book in 2019 raised £125 for BLISS premature babies charity. 

In 2020 all profit will go to GOSH (Great Ormond Street Hospital Children's Charity).

We were blessed in our family with a little grandson who was born at one and half pounds. He is now is now a perfectly healthy, happy little boy. This book was written especially to raise money and say thank you to the NHS and premature baby charities.
